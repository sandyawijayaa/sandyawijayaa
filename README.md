#### Hi there 👋 Nice to meet you, I'm Sandya! 

- 🇮🇩 Born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, then moved to the U.S. for university
- 📚 Currently a Masters student studying Industrial Engineering Operations Research at University of California, Berkeley 
- 👩🏻‍💻 Extremely passionate about all things tech for social impact and am an aspiring environmental data scientist!
- 🌱 My undergraduate honors thesis uses machine learning methods to quantitatively predict how plastic pathways in Indonesia will change given a specific pollution policy is implemented! Check it out under ES-thesis-24 repository. My awesome mentor that helped me make this happen is Professor Kate O’Neill (Associate Dean of RCNR, UC Berkeley)
