#### Hi there 👋 Nice to meet you, I'm Sandya (she/her)! 

- 🇮🇩 Born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia, then moved to the U.S. for college 2 years ago
- 📚 Currently now a senior double majoring in Data Science and Environmental Science at University of California, Berkeley 
- 👩🏻‍💻 Extremely passionate about all things tech for social impact and am an aspiring environmental data scientist!
- 🌱 My undergraduate honors thesis uses machine learning methods to quantitatively predict how plastic pathways in Indonesia will change given a specific pollution policy is implemented! My awesome mentor helping me make this happen is Professor Kate O’Neill (Associate Dean of RCNR, UC Berkeley)
- 🏋️‍♀️ My hobbies span a wide net -- eating (@hangrygirlfeasts is my Insta food blogger alter ego), going on solo dates to cafes & grocery stores, getting artsy with sketching and legos, and a bunch of health & wellness things such as weightlifting, hiking, and badminton
